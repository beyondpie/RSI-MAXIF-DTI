### MAXIF ON DRUG-TARGET PREDICITON
Author: Helen Zhou and Songpeng Zu

#### Introduction
This project is Helen's *first* science project in Tsinghua University under the help of Songpeng. In this project, our aim is not only to predict
drug-protein interactions by maximum information flow algorithm, but also to have a good understanding about the scientific research. We will  

1. Doing a real research, from reading papers, doing the computational experiments to writing papers and making presentations.  
2. Learning several important softwares or programming languages, such as  
   + *Python*, *C++*
   + *Linux*
   + *Emacs*, *Vim*, *Github*, *Latex*

Note that all these things have to be finished within five weeks.
