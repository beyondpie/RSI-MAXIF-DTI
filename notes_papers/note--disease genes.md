###network-based global inference of human disease genes

####assumption 

phenotypically similar diseases are caused by functionally related genes


####goal

integrates human prot-prot interactions disease phenotype similarity and known gene-phenotype associations to capture
complex relationship between phenotypes and genotypes

####applications

1.genetically uncharacterzed phenotypes 

2.effective in the genome-wide scan of disease genes

3.extendable to explore gene cooperativity in complex diseases


####problems

Traditional gene mapping approaches
